CSharpPart1
===========

This repository holds my home works for:
Telerik Academy - C# part 1 (September 2012 - December 2012)

Course Program

* Introduction to Programming
* Primitive Data Types and Variables
* Operators, Expressions and Statements
* Console Input/Output
* Conditional Statements
* Loops

The solutions to the tasks are almost the way they were the day I submitted them, with the exception of some formatting fixes.
